### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Taylor! I'm a full-stack web developer finishing up my training at Lambda School. In addition to the web development skills I've been building there, I have a background in theoretical computer science and experience using Python and NumPy.

I'm currently looking for web development work. You can contact me at [taylorfriesen@protonmail.com](mailto:taylorfriesen@protonmail.com) and I am [taylorfriesen6](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorfriesen6) on LinkedIn.
